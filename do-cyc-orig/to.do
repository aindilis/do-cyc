If LOGICMOO were alpha, I could use LOGICMOO to talk to OCYC, and then, hrm what was it
(#$assignedToTask #$AndrewDougherty #$FigureOutCycLRepresentation)
(#$genls #$FinishTodoSystem #$NonrepeatingTask)
(#$hasRewardForCompletingTask #$AndrewDougherty #$FigureOutCycLRepresentation (#$increaseDiscretionaryFundsBy #$AndrewDougherty (#$dollarsFn 20)))
this stuff is all relatively obvious
so then they're be like:
(#$hasTaskDescription #$FinishTodoSystem "We need to get a machine-readable todo system that will increase self discipline")
(#$hasExpectedDuration #$TakeOutTheTrash (#$minutesFn 5))
do you have any ideas?  this is all like finite numbers but I'm looking for very large ordinals
koo5 — Today at 6:44 PM
what do you mean?

well this stuff is all pretty mundanely true, something more interesting would be the SCID or CYC-ZK
the SCID would be an interactive elicitation system
So like, since you said postpone the SCID, CYC-ZK would have notes:
koo5 — Today at 6:48 PM
well i'd like to set up a situation-aware reminder system for myself
